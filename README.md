## What is it
A **display** of my experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The examples will have HTML, CSS and Javascript all written in one page.
The blogs are publicised on the website of CFOrent and can be found [here](https://cforent.com/news-and-insights/).


## Disclaimer
I am not the administrator of the website, thus, I don't have rights to access 
the stylesheet or the website's environment. That is why, you will read HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript all in a single page. Currently, I am working on a WP child theme to provide to the administrator to be able to work oderly in the future.


Know that it's not advisable to do so, but it works fine the same.
Code should always be written in an orderly fashion, and the web is full with 
pages of styleguides and playbooks on how to work in an efficient and orderly 
manner.
