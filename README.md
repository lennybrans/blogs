## What is it
**A display** of my experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Disclaimer
I am not the adminstrator of the website, thus, I don't have rights to access 
the stylesheet or the website's environment. That is why, you will read HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript all in a single page. <br>
Know that this is not advisable to do so but it works fine no matter what.
Code should always be written in an orderly fashion, and the web is full with 
pages of styleguides and playbooks on how to work in an efficient and orderly 
manner.
