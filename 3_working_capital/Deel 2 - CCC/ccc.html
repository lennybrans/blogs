    <h1>Mastering Your Working Capital - Controlling the Cash Conversion Cycle</h1>
    <p>
      As the saying goes: "Cash is king!". But do you know where your cash is?
      <strong>Welcome to the second part</strong> of our three-part series on 
      mastering your working capital.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Controlling the Cash Conversion Cycle</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Today, we're diving into the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)— a dynamic metric 
      that encompasses three key components: Days of Inventory Outstanding, 
      Days of Sales Outstanding, and Days of Payables Outstanding. In our 
      <a href="https://cforent.com/news-and-insights/mastering-your-working-capital-focus-on-net-working-capital-and-ratios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
        previous blog</a>, 
      we explored Net Working Capital as both an absolute number (current assets 
      minus current liabilities) and as key ratios like the Current and Quick 
      ratios.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CCC, part of asset management ratios, is typically expressed in days. 
      It helps illustrate where your working capital is invested and how long, 
      on average, each dollar stays tied up in your business before it's 
      converted into cash—and hopefully profit. The longer this cycle takes, the 
      more capital is tied up in your operations.
    </p>
    <p>The formula is straightforward:</p>
    <p><strong>CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO</strong></p>
    <p><em>where:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>DIO = Days of Inventory Outstanding</strong></li>
      <li><strong>DSO = Days of Sales Outstanding</strong></li>
      <li><strong>DPO = Days of Payables Outstanding</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These components—Days of Inventory Outstanding (DIO), Days of Sales 
      Outstanding (DSO), and Days of Payables Outstanding (DPO)—are known as 
      activity ratios. The CCC measures the time difference between when your 
      business pays for inventory (DPO) and when it collects cash from sales 
      (DSO), on average. They can be measured over any given period of days, 
      e.g. 30, 90 or 365 days, as long as all components relate to the same 
      period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's be clear: the <strong>CCC is most relevant when your business has 
      all three components</strong>. If your company doesn't have significant 
      inventory, the CCC may not be as useful for managing your working capital. 
      To fully understand your business's cash conversion cycle, three critical 
      questions need to be addressed:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>How much inventory do we need?</li>
      <li>Do we sell on credit? If so, on what terms and to whom do we offer it?</li>
      <li>How do we finance our short-term payables?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Answering these questions will introduce a variety of variables that must 
      be factored in when calculating the Cash Conversion Cycle.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Other cycles in the Mix</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Though we won't delve deeply into them here, it's worth mentioning that 
      there are <strong>several variations</strong> of the cash conversion cycle:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Weighted CCC</strong>: This approach weighs the amount of funds 
        invested at each stage of the cycle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Net Trade Cycle</strong>: A version where all three components 
        (DIO, DSO, and DPO) are related to sales.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Operation Cycle</strong>: Focuses on the asset side, excluding 
        payables.

      <h4>Days Sales Outstanding</h4>
      <p>
        It's a well-known fact that allowing goods to be sold on credit can boost 
        sales. While this practice isn't typically used for small consumer goods 
        in B2C, a large proportion of B2B sales are made on credit. In fact, 
        approximately one-sixth of all assets in U.S. industrial firms are tied 
        up in accounts receivable, according to <em>Fundamentals of Corporate 
        Finance, 10th E.</em> by Stephen A. Ross.
      </p>
      <p>
        DSO represents how much of your working capital is tied up in credit 
        sales. It shows the proportion of assets that are yet to be collected as 
        cash from customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its formula:
        <div class="latex">$$DSO = \frac{\text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Total Credit Sales}} \times \text{# days}$$</div>
        <em>With:</em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Account Receivables</strong>: The amount of money owed to 
            your company from sales that have already been made.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cost of Goods Sold</strong>: The direct costs of producing 
            the goods, representing the working capital investment required to 
            maintain core business operations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Receivables are typically split into two categories:
        <ul>
          <li>Trade credit - credit to other companies.</li>
          <li>Customer credit - credit to customers.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h5>Balancing your DSO</h5>    
      <p>
        Giving out credit to your buyers can increase sales. On the other hand, 
        your company has to be able to lend this money in the first place. You 
        can only do this, with sufficient working capital. If your business 
        finds itself in a production chain, demanding cash payments from your 
        customers can be very difficult, so lending them credit might be 
        necessary. How can your DSO be lowered then? Well, there are several 
        options:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Offer a discount to early payers, for example a 2/10n30 
            (2% in 10 days, else full in 30 days).
          </li>
          <li>
            Factor the accounts receivable. Sell the collected debt to a 
            third-party for a discount.
          </li>
          <li>
            Negotiate a better trade credit (= raising DPO). Depending on the 
            business, higher trade credit can be negotiated. The airplane 
            manufacturer Boeing for example, has allegedly trade credit up to 
            263 days.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      *<strong>CFOrent-tip</strong>*<strong>: Watch out for hidden DSOs!</strong>
        <p>
          CFOrent-associate Benjamin shares an example: <em>"Take CoffeeBeans 
          N.V., a supplier to Moonbucks, a well-known coffeehouse chain. 
          CoffeeBeans N.V. delivers fresh beans every Monday, and the agreed 
          payment terms are 30 days. However, Moonbucks uses an invoice 
          management system that automatically approves invoices within 48 hours. 
          The real payment period then becomes 30 + 2 days.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>If Moonbucks changes its policy to only accept invoices between 
          the 25th and the end of the month, a larger hidden DSO arises. For 
          example, if CoffeeBeans N.V. delivers on April 5th but can't send 
          the invoice until the 25th, which then needs 48 hours for approval 
          and another 30 days to be paid, the real DSO becomes 20 + 2 + 30 —a 
          staggering 52 days. Not what they agreed upon, is it?"</em>

    <div id="DIO" class="tab-content">
      <h4>Days of Inventory Outstanding</h4>
      <p>
        Days of Inventory Outstanding (DIO) has many synonyms, but they all 
        point to the same concept: how quickly can a business convert its 
        inventory  into sales? This metric reflects how long a company's 
        inventory  typically lasts, from the moment it enters storage until it 
        is sold  and leaves the premises. While the ideal DIO varies across 
        industries,  a lower number is generally preferred, as high DIOs may 
        signal  inventory mismanagement or sales challenges.
      </p>
      <p>The formula is:</p>
      <div class="latex" style="overflow:auto; max-width: 100%;">
        $$DIO = \frac{\text{Average Inventory}}{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}} 
        \times \text{# days} = \frac{1}{\text{inventory turnover}} 
        \times \text{# days}$$
      </div>
      <p><em>With:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Average Inventory</strong>: The total value of all 
          materials—raw, processed, or finished—that are essential for 
          maintaining the company's core activities and directly related to its 
          turnover (and profit).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</strong>: The direct costs of 
          producing the goods, representing the working capital investment 
          required to maintain core business operations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Essentially, DIO is a ratio that compares the value of average 
        inventory to the total cost of generating those goods. The result shows 
        the portion of COGS represented by your inventory. By multiplying this 
        figure by, for example 365 days, we express the result in a more intuitive 
        format—how many days your inventory typically remains unsold.  
      </p>
      <p>
        While the formula suggests that a smaller average inventory is more 
        beneficial, the reality is more complex. Larger inventories can help 
        stabilise price fluctuations and reduce order costs, but they also 
        increase carrying costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the characteristics of your inventory depletion, several 
        models—like the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), the Part-Period 
        Algorithm, Just-In-Time, or Least Unit Cost approach—can 
        optimise your inventory management and help you achieve the best DIO 
        for your business.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="DPO" class="tab-content">
      <h4>Days Payables Outstanding</h4>
      <p>
        Days of Payables Outstanding is the last of the three components. The 
        ratio depicts how many days you can defer payments. A high DPO means 
        purchases, on average don't have to be paid immediately but rather after 
        a certain amount of days.
      </p>
      <p>Its formula:</p>
      <div class="latex" style="overflow:auto; max-width: 100%;">
        $$DPO = \frac{\text{Accounts Payables}}{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}} \times \text{# days}$$
      </div>
      <p><em>With:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cost of Goods Sold</strong>: Begin inventory + purchases + end 
          inventory.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        DPO becomes interesting when we put it in perspective of other metrics, 
        such as the DSO or the operating cycle.
      </p>
      <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
      <h5>DSO versus DPO</h5>
      <p>
        Comparing these two components will tell you whether your clients pay 
        your business faster than you pay your suppliers. If they do not, your 
        company will have to provide the financing of working capital itself 
        and this can become a very expensive affair. In a company, we 
        differentiate two ways of financing: equity or debt. Banks or similar
        institutions offer loans with interest. 
        <a href="https://cforent.com/news-and-insights/planning-growth-based-on-interest-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        Euribor rates</a> for one month are around 3.38%, add between 1 - 2.5% 
        on top and covering your working capital by loan will cost you ± 5% of 
        the required working capital. The other option is to ask the 
        shareholders to invest a little more. Shareholders usually expect higher
        returns on invest because they carry more risk and your company might 
        be looking at a much higher percentage on top of the working capital 
        needs. Our upcoming article on WACC will explore this further.

      <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
        *<strong>CFOrent-tip</strong>*: 
        A high DPO can also send out a negative signal into the world, as they 
        can be related to payment troubles. Professor Corporate Finance Marc 
        Deloof of the University of Antwerp concluded in a study of around a 
        thousand Belgian companies, that managers who lower the DSO and DIO can 
        create value for shareholders and that less profitable firms, wait 
        longer to pay their bills.

      <h5>Operating Cycle</h5>
      <p>
        The operating cycle gives an estimation in days of your entire core 
        business operation. It starts the days you receive your raw materials 
        (or similar) in inventory and it ends when you have sold everything AND 
        collected the money. The operating thus exists out of two other cycles: 
        the DPO and the Cash Cycle.

    <h2>Unveil the Opportunity Cost of Your CCC</h2>
    <p>
      Investing funds has a price. In the standard example of our calculator 
      below, we notice a CCC of 138 days. In other words, for every euro we 
      invest it will take on average 138 days to turn into revenue. However, the 
      WACC sets expectations of what the return on our investment should be. 
      Tying this one euro up in our business activities has a cost for our 
      business. Play around in our calculator and find out how these parameters 
      influence the opportunity cost for investing your working capital. Do you 
      see what happens if you manage to get a negative CCC?

  <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Having discussed the components of the CCC, we've discovered its more 
    actionable nature. Converting ratios into <em>days</em>, provides a more 
    insightful way to understand where your working capital is being spend or 
    stuck. Each component has several underlying assets or liabilities that 
    need to be assessed in order to balance your working capital.
  </p>
  <p>
    Working Capital Management always needs to be assessed within the nature 
    of your business and compared with relevant companies/competitors. The Cash 
    Conversion Cycle is no exception of this philosophy.
  </p>
  <h2 style="font-size:24px; font-weight: bold;">Coming up...</h2>
  <p>
    In our third and last part of our three-part series, we will talk about the 
    Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). In this article, we mentioned that 
    shareholders may expect a high return on their investment and therefore are 
    not always the most suitable moneylenders for our business. The WACC gives 
    an indication of our debt, allows us to leverage debt-to-equity and 
    provides a meaningful number to decide whether an investment will be worth 
    it.
