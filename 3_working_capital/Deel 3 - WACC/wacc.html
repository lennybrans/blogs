    <section id="introduction">
      <p>
        Welcome to our third and final article in the Mastering Working Capital 
        series! In this installment, we'll dive into the Weighted Average Cost 
        of Capital, or WACC. 
      </p>
      <p>
        WACC is a powerful metric for evaluating investments, giving insights 
        into whether new projects will meet the minimum return required by both 
        equity and debt stakeholders. This metric reflects the full scope of a 
        company's capital structure by considering loans, shareholders' equity, 
        required returns, and corporate tax deductions. While best known for 
        investment analysis, WACC is versatile—it can also inform decisions in 
        areas like expansion, R&D, and long-term funding strategies.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          A firm's weighted average cost of capital has important applications 
          other than the discount rate in capital project evaluations. For 
          instance, it is a key ingredient to measure a firm's true economic 
          profit, or what I like to call EVA, standing for economic value added. 
          [...] Starting in the early 1990s, firms around the world—ranging from 
          Coca-Cola, to Briggs & Stratton, Herman Miller, and Eli Lilly in 
          America, Siemens in Germany, Tata Consulting and the Godrej Group out 
          of India, Brahma Beer in Brazil, and many, many more—began to turn to 
          EVA as a new and better way to measure performance and set goals, 
          make decisions and determine bonuses, and to communicate with 
          investors and to teach business and finance basics to managers and 
          employees. Properly tailored and implemented, EVA is a natural way to 
          bring the cost of capital to life and to turn everyone in a company 
          into a capital conscientious, owner-entrepreneur.

      <h3>Inside the WACC Formula: Key Components Explained</h3>
      <p>
        The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) represents the minimum 
        return rate a company needs to achieve on its invested capital to meet 
        the expectations of its investors and cover its overall financing costs. 
        WACC serves as a benchmark, guiding decision-makers in assessing the 
        profitability of both current activities and potential future investments.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it's crucial to remember that WACC isn't a 'one-size-fits-all' 
        metric; each use case requires a distinct calculation based on 
        specific circumstances, such as industry factors, capital structure, 
        and project-specific risks. Let's start by examining the individual 
        components of the WACC formula.
      </p>
      <div class="latex" style="overflow:auto; max-width: 100%;">
        $$\text{WACC}=(\frac {E}{V}) * R_{E} + (\frac {D}{V}) * R_{D} * 
        (1 - T_{C})$$

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><sup>E</sup>&frasl;<sub>V</sub> = the

          </span> 
          of equity.
        </li>
        <li><sup>D</sup>&frasl;<sub>V</sub> = the capital structure weight of 
            debt.
        </li>
        <li>V = market value</li>
        <li>R<sub>E</sub> = Cost of equity</li>
        <li>R<sub>D</sub> = Cost of debt</li>
        <li>T<sub>C</sub> = Corporate tax rate</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
      <h4>Rules:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use the market value, not the accounting value. Market values provide 
          a more accurate snapshot of the current costs of capital than 
          historical, book-based accounting value
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure each component represents funds currently used in operationsor 
          earmarked for future investments, reflecting the actual sources of 
          capital in the company's financing structure
        </li>
        <li>
          Always calculate the debt factor
            <span class="tooltip">after-tax
              <span class="tooltip-text">
                <p>
                  Just like mortgage interest, corporate loan interest is tax 
                  deductable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if a loan's interest rate is 8%, the after-tax 
                  cost is calculated as 8% * (1 - T<sub>C</sub>), where 
                  T<sub>C</sub> is the corporate tax rate.
                </p>
                <strong>Example Calculation:</strong>
                <p>Interest rate = 8%
                  <br>Corporate Tax Rate is 25%
                  <br>E.g. 8% * (1 - 25%) = <strong>6%</strong>.
                </p>
              </span>
            </span>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A simple example: if the WACC for an investment is, say 6%. Then that 
        serves as the required return rate to maintain the company's value 
        relative to its capital costs. If we plan to invest €1,000, then the 
        cost of capital will be €60, calculated as follows: 1,000 * (1 + 0.06) 
        = 1,060.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note: In this article, we'll simplify calculations 
        to focus on when and how to use WACC. In practice, calculating WACC 
        is more complex, often requiring financial experts who analyse 
        various funding sources and their associated costs. We'll 
        illustrate these principles with a fictional, publicly traded 
        company, AB Bieren N.V.</em>

      <h3>Know the Influences Impacting WACC</h3>
      <p>
        AB Bieren N.V. plans to open a new production line in Belgium to expand 
        its capacity, with an estimated investment of 
        <span id="investmentText">5 M</span>. Understanding the composition of 
        its capital structure allows us to calculate a tailored WACC, factoring 
        in both equity and debt costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this project, AB Bieren N.V. plans to fund 
        <span id="ev_weight">50</span>% (<span id="stockAmount">2.5 M</span>)
        through issuing new stock and the remaining
        <span id="dv_weight">50</span>%(<span id="loanAmount">2.5 M</span>) 
        via a bank loan. New shareholders are promised a
        <span id="costEq">15</span>% return, reflecting the higher risk 
        typically associated with equity. On the debt side, the bank, which 
        requires lower returns on secured loans, will charge a 
        <span id="costDebt">4.5</span>%interest rate. The current Belgian 
        corporate tax rate is 25%, which will affect the after-tax cost of debt 
        in our WACC calculation.

      <p>
        With a WACC of 
        <span id="wacc_result">0</span>, 
        the minimum return from the new production line must be 
        <span id="min_return">0</span>.
        <br>AB Bieren now needs to evaluate 
        whether they can achieve this minimum return—and ideally exceed it 
        to generate profit. Enter the Net Present Value (NPV). 
      </p>
      <p>
        NPV will help AB Bieren determine if the project's returns justify 
        the investment, using WACC as the discount rate. The company anticipates 
        a 10-year service life for the production line, with an annual net 
        cash inflow of 
        <span id="gross_cash_flow">2,000,000</span> and costs of 
        <span id="cost_cash_flow">1,250,000</span>, resulting in an annual 
        Net Cash Flow of 
        <span id="net_cash_flow">750,000</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NPV formula is as follows: 
        $$\text{NPV} = \text{present value of expected returns}-\text{cost of investment}$$
        The present value of expected returns is projected to be 
        <span id="present_value">0</span>, leaving an NPV of 
        <span id="npv">0</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to theory, AB Bieren should proceed with the investment if 
        the NPV is positive or zero, as this indicates that the return meets 
        or exceeds the WACC. However, a negative NPV suggests the investment 
        may not achieve the required returns and could be reconsidered.

      <h3>Leveraging debt</h3>
      <p>
        Despite a negative NPV, AB Bieren is committed to launching the new 
        production line, confident that the market demand justifies the 
        investment. By revisiting their financing options, AB Bieren adjusts 
        the capital structure to a 40-60 split: 40% from equity (investors) 
        and 60% from debt. Try it yourself and notice how this change 
        impacts the NPV.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, just on 17 october 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) 
        announced plans to 
        <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2024/html/ecb.mp241017~aa366eaf20.en.html#:~:text=ECB%20interest%20rates-,The%20Governing%20Council%20today%20decided%20to%20lower%20the%20three%20key,effect%20from%2023%20October%202024." target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          lower the interest rates</a>,
        giving AB Bieren leverage to renegotiate its loan rate down to 4%. 
        With these adjustments, the NPV turns positive, reaching €78,277, 
        allowing AB Bieren to green-light the project. This approach is 
        known as “leveraging debt”—a strategy used to enhance returns by 
        increasing debt financing when conditions are favourable. However, 
        it's essential to manage debt levels carefully, as too much leverage 
        introduces higher financial risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice how these changes also impact the WACC. This sensitivity to 
        factors like capital structure and interest rates underscores the 
        importance of WACC and its components. Getting WACC right is crucial 
        for a company to make sound investment decisions. Yet, one final 
        insight remains unseen in the WACC formula: the cost of capital 
        hinges more on the <em>use</em> of funds than their source. For 
        instance, capital allocated to high-growth projects may justify a 
        higher WACC, while low-risk investments may require a lower threshold. 
        This focus on <strong>purpose over origin</strong> highlights that 
        strategic, effective use of capital is the true driver of sustainable 
        returns and value creation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        *<strong>CFOrent-tip</strong>*:
        "<strong>A good practice</strong> is to make simulations of the WACC, 
        where you incorporate various macro-economic factors that might 
        influence the  WACC. This way, we can create a better risk-profile 
        for the  investment." Says Anthony, CFOrent associate. "However, the 
        WACC  cannot be the only metric to consider. In the end, a clear 
        vision  statement determines what investments really matter for a 
        company.  The metrics are merely tools to fine-tune the investment 
        and to make an educated decission."

      <h3>Balancing Shareholder Equity and Debt in WACC</h3>
      <p>
        In calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), a company's 
        capital structure—its mix of shareholder equity and debt—plays a 
        critical role. Let's explore why companies use a combination of these 
        financing sources, and how each affects the cost of capital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shareholder equity represents the ownership stake in a company. When a 
        company raises capital by issuing shares, it gives investors a claim on 
        future profits. In return, shareholders expect a certain rate of return, 
        or cost of equity, which reflects the level of risk they're taking. The 
        cost of equity tends to be higher than the cost of debt, as shareholders 
        assume greater risk: unlike lenders, they are paid only after all debts 
        are settled and receive returns based on performance.<br>While equity 
        doesn't require fixed repayments like debt, it carries an implicit cost
        —the returns shareholders expect for their investment. This expectation 
        is part of the WACC formula, and it reflects the “price” a company pays 
        to retain investor support and avoid diluting ownership.
      </p>
      <h4>Why Use Debt? The Power of Leverage</h4>
      <p>
        Debt, on the other hand, offers an alternative financing path. Unlike 
        equity, debt requires regular interest payments but provides several 
        advantages:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Lower Cost: Debt generally has a lower cost than equity because 
            lenders assume less risk. They have a contractual right to repayment, 
            often backed by collateral, and are typically first in line during 
            any liquidation process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tax Deductibility: Interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, 
            reducing the company's overall tax burden. This tax advantage lowers 
            the effective cost of debt in the WACC formula, making it an 
            attractive option for many companies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Controlled Ownership: Unlike issuing shares, debt does not dilute 
            existing ownership, allowing current shareholders to maintain 
            control over the company.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>The Balance Between Equity and Debt</h4>
      <p>
        Finding the right balance between shareholder equity and debt is key to 
        managing WACC effectively. While debt can lower WACC due to its lower 
        cost and tax benefits, excessive debt can increase financial risk, 
        potentially affecting credit ratings, operational flexibility, and 
        shareholder confidence. On the other hand, too much reliance on equity 
        may increase WACC, as equity holders expect a higher return. In the WACC 
        calculation, the cost of equity and cost of debt are weighted according 
        to their proportion in the company's capital structure. By optimizing 
        this balance, companies can achieve a lower WACC, making it easier to 
        pursue growth opportunities with more favorable returns.
      </p>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        In understanding the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), we've seen 
        that it is far more than a simple metric. WACC serves as a guiding 
        compass for companies like AB Bieren N.V., helping them evaluate whether 
        an investment will meet the necessary returns to satisfy both debt 
        obligations and equity expectations. By breaking down WACC's components 
        and experimenting with factors such as capital structure and interest 
        rates, companies can make informed choices, optimising their financing 
        approach to align with strategic goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as we uncovered, calculating WACC isn't merely about numbers. It's 
        about aligning the cost of capital with the intended purpose of the 
        investment. Ultimately, WACC encourages businesses to use capital wisely 
        and strategically, driving growth in ways that create sustainable value. 
        With this tool, companies can approach each investment opportunity not 
        just with financial prudence but with an eye toward the future—a future 
        where every investment serves a purpose beyond profit alone.
