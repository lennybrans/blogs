      Is your business running smoothly day-to-day? If not, the issue might be 
      hidden in your working capital management. Welcome to the <strong>
      first article in our three-part series on mastering working capital, a 
      critical element in maintaining a healthy business</strong>. Today, we'll 
      dive into the fundamentals—Net Working Capital, the Current Ratio, and the 
      Quick Ratio/Acid Test. In part two, we'll explore the Cash Conversion 
      Cycle and in part three, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of this article, there is <strong>a web tool to check out the 
      Net Working Capital and ratios</mark></strong> of other Belgian companies.

    <h2 style="font-size:24px;font-weight: bold;">Understanding Net Working Capital</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Net Working Capital (NWC)</strong> is a key metric that assesses a 
      company's liquidity and operational efficiency by evaluating its 
      short-term assets and liabilities. Essentially, it's the difference 
      between current assets (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, inventory) and 
      current liabilities (e.g., accounts payable, short-term debt). Analyzing 
      your NWC helps determine if your business has <strong>the financial 
      flexibility</mark></strong> it needs.
    </p>
    <p>The formula is straightforward:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Net Working Capital (NWC) = Current Assets - Current Liabilities</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:15px">
      <em>*In Corporate Finance, 'current' refers to a time period up to 1 year 
      or less*</em>
    </p>
    <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
    <p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Examples</strong></p>
    <p>
      To illustrate how Net Working Capital (NWC) can differ across industries, 
      we'll <strong>compare three companies using their financial statements</strong> 
      as submitted to the National Bank of Belgium, in 2022.
    </p>
    <p>Our three companies will be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dreamland</strong>, a toy retailer.</li>
      <li><strong>KPMG</strong>, a financial advisory institution.</li>
      <li><strong>Dovy Keukens</strong>, a manufacturer of high-end kitchens.</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
    <p>
      We'll use the following accounting codes to determine their current assets:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inventory </strong>(code 3)<em> (voorraden)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Accounts receivable</strong> (40/41)<em> (vorderingen op ten hoogste één jaar)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Financial investments</strong> (50/53)<em> (geldbeleggingen)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Liquid assets</strong> (54/58)<em> (liquide middelen)</em></li>
      <li><strong>Accrued accounts</strong> (490/1)<em> (overlopende rekeningen)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
    <p>For current liabilities, we'll use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Current debt</strong> (42/48)<em> 
          (schulden op ten hoogste één jaar)</em>, including:
          <ul><li>Accounts payable (44) <em>(handelsschulden)</em></li></ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Accrued accounts</strong> (492/3)<em> (overlopende rekeningen)</em></li>
    </ul>

  <section id="know-your-company">
    <h2 style="font-size:24px;font-weight: bold;">Know Your Company</h2>
    <p>
      Net Working Capital is simply a <strong>snapshot of your company's 
      financial position</strong> at a specific moment in time. At first glance, 
      Dreamland might seem to be in the best position because it has the highest 
      NWC among the companies we've examined. However, reality paints a 
      different picture. Despite its high NWC, Dreamland was struggling in 2021, 
      which led Colruyt Group to sell its majority stake in March 2023 because 
      the business was no longer viable.
    </p>
    <p>Let's break this down:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Dreamland has an inventory valued at €73.772.969. If they were to sell 
        all of it today, they would convert this into liquid assets of the same 
        value.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dovy Keukens has an inventory valued at €28.845.696. If they were to use 
        this inventory to construct new kitchens and then sell them, that money 
        would become a liquid asset.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
    <p>
      However, the <strong>nature of these inventories is vastly different</strong>. 
      Dreamland's inventory consists primarily of toys, products that are 
      heavily influenced by trends, seasons, and other market forces. In 
      contrast, Dovy Keukens' inventory consists of raw materials and components 
      necessary for manufacturing high-end kitchens. For Dovy Keukens, these 
      materials are not the end product but rather the means to create a product.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>key difference is in risk</strong>. Dreamland faces the risk 
      of significant loss if a new toy hits the market before they can sell 
      older inventory, not to mention the costs of storing unsold goods. That 
      €73 million in inventory could lose value rapidly. Dovy Keukens, on the 
      other hand, can convert their inventory into finished products that retain 
      their value and generate revenue upon sale.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      *<strong>CFOrent-tip</strong>*: A high inventory cycle, i.e. how quickly 
      an inventory is turned over, can be problematic. A thorough sales forecast 
      in combination with well-thought purchasing policy will strengthen your 
      business and keep volatility down. Our associates are experts in guiding 
      you and making a well-founded sales forecast and purchasing policy.

    <p>
      Below, we'll explore the proportion of each type of current activa, for 
      each company:
    </p>

    <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

    <iframe width="900" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" 
      src="//plotly.com/~lennybrans/26.embed" loading="eager"></iframe>

    <div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>

    <p>
      When we consider <strong>Dreamland's inventory as the most volatile asset
      </strong> within the company's current assets, Dreamland's financial 
      position looks more precarious. A striking 75.4% of its current assets are 
      tied up in 'volatile inventory.' In contrast, while <strong>Dovy Keukens 
      has 70.7% of its current assets in inventory, this inventory is far more 
      stable</strong> and likely to retain its value, as we discussed earlier.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="know-your-debt">
    <h2 style="font-size:24px;font-weight: bold;">Know Your Debt</h2>
    <p>Let's examine the short-term debt figures for our three companies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dreamland</strong>: €59.109.943</li>
      <li><strong>KPMG</strong>: €36.612.051</li>
      <li><strong>Dovy Keukens</strong>: €27.797.340</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
    <p>
      Given Dreamland's situation, with over 75% of its assets in volatile 
      inventory, the company is in a <strong>precarious position</strong>, 
      especially when coupled with its substantial debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      KPMG, with a debt of €36 million, is in a <strong>stronger position</strong>. 
      The company's assets total approximately €40 million, with less than 10% 
      tied up in inventory. Dovy Keukens falls somewhere in between, with about 
      29% of its assets in less volatile forms and a more stable inventory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The financial world acknowledges the <strong>importance</strong> of 
      considering <strong>both the stability of assets and the amount of debt
      </strong>. That's why two important ratios come into play:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Current ratio</strong>: current assets / current liabilities</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Quick ratio</strong> or <strong>acid test</strong>: (current 
        assets - inventory) / current liabilities
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>
    <p>
      These ratios help us better understand Net Working Capital (NWC) in a more 
      actionable way. They allow us to say, "higher, lower, or in between is 
      better" based on the context. Inter-industry operations differ 
      substantially so the <strong>ratios are only relevant when comparing 
      companies within industries and similar operations</strong>. Generally, it 
      is assumed that 2:1 for the Current Ratio and 1:1 for the Quick Ratio are 
      stable ratios. A ratio of less than 1 indicates that the company may have 
      problems meeting its short-term obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      By comparing the current and quick ratios, we can better gauge the impact 
      of inventory on a company's liquidity. Suddenly, KPMG's financial 
      stability seems much stronger when we consider these ratios. Interesting, 
      isn't it?

    <blockquote>
      <strong>*CFOrent-tip*</strong>: <strong>The other underlying components of 
      the formula are as relevant as inventory. If payment terms for Accounts 
      Receivable and Accounts Payable are not aligned, cash flow problems will 
      arise sooner or later. Renegotiating payment terms or negotiating 
      discounts for immediate payment can offer relief in these situations, says 
      CFOrent-associate Maxim.</strong>

    <p>
      The metrics we've discussed provide a snapshot, but they don't account for 
      the inherent differences in business models. For instance, Dreamland and 
      Dovy Keukens have relatively big inventories, while KPMG's inventory will 
      likely consist of office supplies, worth only €4 million. This variation 
      highlights the <strong>importance of contextualising these metrics</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Understanding your competition is crucial</strong>. For example, 
      in 2022, Colruyt Group was the majority shareholder of Dreamland, whereas 
      its competitor, FUN N.V., had a more diversified shareholder base. Colruyt 
      Group could leverage its established distribution network, potentially 
      giving Dreamland an edge in inventory management. Conversely, could FUN 
      N.V. match this advantage?
    </p>
    <p>
      KPMG, along with its rivals Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and PwC, benefits 
      from a global support network that can absorb financial hits. Starting a 
      business in direct competition with these giants requires finding a niche 
      to remain competitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, Dovy Keukens operates as a major player locally but is small on 
      a global scale. Their custom-made kitchens limit their reach to customers 
      compared to IKEA, which has a worldwide presence. While both are 
      well-known in Belgium, they are not necessarily direct competitors.

    <h2 style="font-size:24px;font-weight: bold;">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In this article, we have discussed the Net Working Capital and it's ratios 
      and we have shown its underlying components. Using our examples, we 
      focused on the component "inventory" and shown the importance of 
      understanding how it impacts the absolute value of Net Working Capital. 
      Later, <strong>the ratios have proven to be a more insightful way</strong> 
      of understanding the distribution of assets and liability and they can 
      give a clear indication of where the vulnerabilities of a company lie. 
      However, they <strong>always</strong> have to be <strong>put in context</strong> 
      and reference <strong>with similar companies</strong> and are still 
      superficial metrics.

      Stay tuned for part two of our series on Working Capital next month. We 
      will <strong>cover the Cash Conversion Cycle</strong>, a more dynamic and 
      insightful metric than Net Working Capital. It often <strong>provides a 
      clearer picture</strong> of your business's liquidity. While <strong>Net 
      Working Capital measures your ability to cover day-to-day</strong> 
      operations, it doesn't capture the full picture of how efficiently your 
      capital flows through your business. Even if your Net Working Capital 
      appears healthy, you might still face challenges in paying your bills if 
      your capital is tied up in various parts of your operations.
